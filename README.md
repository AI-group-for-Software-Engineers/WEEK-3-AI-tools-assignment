# Machine Learning and NLP Projects Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects demonstrating classical machine learning, deep learning (CNNs), and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
Each project addresses a distinct problem, from image classification to sentiment analysis.

## üöÄ Projects

### 1. Iris Species Classification

* **File:** `iris_classification.py`
* **Purpose:** This script implements a classical machine learning model to classify the species of Iris flowers based on their features.
* **Model/Algorithm:** **Decision Tree Classifier**.
* **Key Libraries:** **Scikit-learn** (for the model and metrics), **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Streamlit** (for the interactive web application interface).
* **Functionality:** It trains the model, displays a sample of the **Iris Species** dataset, calculates and presents performance metrics (**Accuracy**, **Precision**, **Recall**, **Confusion Matrix**), and visualizes the structure of the Decision Tree.

### 2. Natural Language Processing with spaCy

* **File:** `nlp-with-spacy (1).ipynb`
* **Purpose:** A Jupyter Notebook exploring fundamental Natural Language Processing tasks on text data.
* **Dataset:** **Amazon reviews**.
* **Key Libraries:** **spaCy** (for core NLP tasks), **Pandas**.
* **Focus:** The notebook demonstrates how to process text and is used to analyze the reviews and determine their **sentiment** (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).

### 3. CNN for MNIST Digit Recognition

* **File:** `TF_cnn_MNIST.ipynb`
* **Purpose:** A deep learning project that implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification.
* **Model/Algorithm:** **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.
* **Dataset:** **MNIST** (handwritten digits).
* **Key Libraries:** **TensorFlow** / **Keras**.
* **Performance:** The model is trained over 5 epochs, achieving a high test accuracy (e.g., **99.02%**). The notebook also generates a plot of training accuracy and loss over the epochs.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Project Deliverables & Submission Requirements

In addition to the code files, the following supplementary materials are required for submission:

### 1. Project Report (PDF)

A comprehensive PDF report is required, covering the project's theoretical and practical aspects. This report should be:
* **Shared as an article** in the Community, Peer Group Review.
* **Included** in this GitHub Repository.

The report must contain:
* **Answers to theoretical questions** related to the models and concepts used.
* **Screenshots of model outputs** (e.g., accuracy graphs, NER results, confusion matrices).
* A section dedicated to **Ethical Reflection** on the dataset, model usage, and potential societal impact.

### 2. Presentation (Video)

A short video presentation is required to explain your approach.
* **Length:** The video should be approximately **3 minutes** long.
* **Participation:** **All members** in the group should participate in the video.
* **Submission:** **Share the video** on the Community platform.
